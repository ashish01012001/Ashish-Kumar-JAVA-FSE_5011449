1) Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Answer: 
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It provides a way to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
Purpose: It helps in analyzing and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, particularly for large input sizes.

2) Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Answer:
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) - The element being searched is the first element in the array.
Average Case: O(n) - The element could be anywhere in the array.
Worst Case: O(n) - The element is the last one or not present in the array.
Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) - The middle element is the target.
Average Case: O(log n) - The array is repeatedly divided in half.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The element is at the first or last position of a sorted array.

3) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Answer: 
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)
Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)

4) Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
Answer: 
Binary Search is generally more suitable for e-commerce platforms because:
It has a significantly lower average and worst-case time complexity compared to linear search, making it more efficient for large datasets.
It requires the data to be sorted, which might add an overhead if the data frequently changes.
